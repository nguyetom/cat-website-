Cat Website â€“ Responsive Web Design Project
As part of my journey into software development, I am currently completing the Responsive Web Design Certification offered by freeCodeCamp. This project represents one of the first hands-on exercises in the course: building a basic cat-themed website using HTML.

The main goal of this project is to apply foundational HTML concepts such as structuring content, using semantic elements, and organizing layout in a clear and accessible way. While simple, it lays the groundwork for understanding responsive design principles and front-end development.

This repository serves as a record of my progress and a demonstration of my commitment to mastering web development through practical, real-world examples.
